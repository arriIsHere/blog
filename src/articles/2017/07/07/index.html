  <p>Among my many hobbies is tabletop Roleplaying games. GURPs,
  Dungeons and Dragons, and DC Heros, for example, are all systems I've used or run for.
  Recently I went through the process of building a NPC manager (you can test it
  out <a href="https://bblais23.github.io/npc-manager" rel="noopener noreferrer"
  target="_blank">here</a>).</p>

  <h2>Tabletops and Tools</h2>
  <p>Stylistically, I prefer to run table-top games with as little technology or
  software as possible. I take my notes using paper and pencil, and my DM screen
  hides mounds of notebooks and paper.</p>

  <p>NPC management though, that's an area that presents a unique problem to me.
  Coming up with names on the fly isn't something I'm particularly good at, and
  crossing an NPC's name off a list and writing it down takes way too long.</p>

  <p>Making an app seemed the logical solution, I could run an I on my phone,
  use it while I played seamlessly, and I could generate an NPC much quicker than
  before.</p>

  <h2>Front-loading the App</h2>
  <p>I didn't want to have to deal with persistent storage or databases so I opted
  to make the application exclusively front-end. If you had time to check it out
  already, you would notice NPCManger has save/load buttons. This is to allow the
  persistence of data between sessions without having to rely on cookies or databases.</p>

  <h2>Side-Quests</h2>
  <p>I like all my projects to be opportunities for learning. That way, even if
  the finished product proves to be useless at the very least I learned something.</p>

  <h3>EMs for the GMs</h3>
  <p>For NPCManager, I wanted to improve my CSS Unit game, the intent was to style
  everything using EMs or REMs, so a slight font change would scale up the DPI of all
  objects on the screen, allowing the whole page to look the same, but bigger.
  The results were amazing, not only was I able to make items relatively sized to
  their parents, but I could scale the page up and down by changing the root font
  size.</p>

  <h3>Mobile first</h3>
  <p>I always try to make my projects "mobile-first" web applications, but this
  was the first time I took this seriously. I suspect the need to make this work
  on a smartphone and only having desktop as an afterthought provided the
  encouragement that was necessary, but whatever the reason this was the first time
  I actually made mobile the top priority.</p>

  <h3>Improved Agility</h3>
  <p>Time was a major constraint for this project, it was imperative that the tool
  be done before the next game session. One solution would have been to lower
  expectations, but I choose instead to make incremental improvements to the app,
  scrum-style.</p>

  <h2>Gametime</h2>
  <p>The end result was a simple and useful tool. It can be improved but the
  important thing is it's written and designed relatively well. I tested it in my
  first session and it seemed to work relatively well aside from a few hiccups.</p>

  <h3>Retrospective</h3>
  <p>The glitches I found in my app were mostly simple (dumb) bugs. These all could
  be caught by doing unit tests for the data. The next time I do a project I intend
  to add unit tests to the project to avoid this in the future.</p>

  <p>In spite of the bugs, the things that worked well with this project worked
  really well. Incremental development ensured I had a sliding scale of sorts for
  features of this app, The EM based styling worked in a beautiful top-down styling
  for the app, and the mobile-first development allows for a beautiful web-application
  usable on almost all devices.</p>
