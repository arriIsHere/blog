  <p>Unlike my website, which was more of an experiment with web components, this blog
  was built to be compatible. One aspect of this compatibility was the decision
  to support browsers that either did not have, or had disabled, JavaScript. For some,
  this may seem like a rather limiting design choice. But as I am about to explain, this
  is not quite as big a problem as you would think.</p>

  <h3>JavaScript is For Webapps, Not For Websites</h3>
  <p>Most web developers and designers agree that, since the advent of HTML5,
  the three primary parts of the web (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) are to follow a design
  pattern not unlike MVC (Model, View, Controller). In the case of the web, the HTML
  is expected to behave similar to the Model, the CSS is somewhat like a view, and 
  the JavaScript will play the part of the controller. These design pasterns may not be apples
  and apples, but there is enough similarity between the two for the analogy to work for this
  argument.</p>
  <p>In the case of a Webapp the data is changing based on user reactions to it,
  a controller is required to handle input from the user. What about the case of a website
  or a web article? Well, in these instances, user interaction does not really play a role.
  You have information and a way you want the information displayed (the view and the model).</p>

  <h3>You Probably Don't Need JavaScript</h3>
  <p>In much the same way that the addition of built-in browser methods changed JQuery into an 
  <a href="http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">unnecessary library</a>, new
  CSS selectors have made some of the common JavaScript solutions to web styling
  obsolete. Take the classic accordion for example. Traditionally, you create this by
  using a click event handler to trigger the toggling of a class which will allow 
  special styling to activate (hiding the accordion content).</p>
  <iframe width="100%" height="300" src="https://jsfiddle.net/9fmc4d4f/embedded/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>
  <p>This seems logical to most people. After all, the user is clicking and by doing
  so, changing the page. But what if I am thinking of the content as temporarily hidden?
  Think of the :hover pseudo selector. This is just content that I am choosing to hide
  or display differently until it becomes focused (hovered or clicked).</p>
  <p>There is a problem though, no :clicked pseudo-selector exists, so how can I
  open my accordion without tapping into an event handler? It's actually quite simple, instead
  of thinking of accordion as a div (as it is traditionally done) think of it as a large
  label for a checkbox.</p>
  <iframe width="100%" height="300" src="https://jsfiddle.net/2Lpy9jvL/embedded/html,css,result/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>
  <p>It probably seems a bit strange, to add the checkbox to the element only
  to hide it. But don't forget this is exactly what many designers already do.
  Custom styled checkboxes are just regular checkboxes with their content hidden
  and a customized label or ::before pseudo-element. The accordion only takes things
  a few steps further.</p>

  <h3>Graceful Degradation</h3>
  <p>One of the great achievements of the web is it's ability to handle differing levels
  of compatibility. If I add some new CSS3 selectors to my styling document, the 
  elements will still display even if the user's browser does not support them. 
  One reason to not use JavaScript is CSS has a much more smooth degradation system. 
  You can easily write rules and, if a browser does not support them, they just won't
  be displayed. I find this more elegant than JavaScript's programmatic method, where 
  it must first be checked if something exists.</p>

  <h3>Considerations</h3>
  <p>There is one concession to be made when styling without JavaScript, the loss 
  of polyfills. One thing JavaScript does allow you to do, that you quite
  simply can't in CSS, is write some code to perform a task that is not supported
  by the browser. </p>
  <p>This is just something you need to consider when styling your site though.
  Since styling is usually one of those places where extra support for things 
  is usually extra (animations and transitions come to mind), it is nothing to be
  overly concerned about. Just remember, if something you are using in CSS isn't 
  supported by all major browsers, design you website assuming that it won't be there.</p>

  <p>CSS has come a really long way in the past few years and has many great features. 
  Styling websites using it is easier than ever and allows you to display things
  in much more creative ways. It has come to the point with styling functionality that
  you might not actually need JavaScript at all.</p>
