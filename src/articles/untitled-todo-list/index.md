If you saw my last post [Webdev on a chromebook](../developing-on-chromebook) this is a good followup for it.
Here, I want to continue my guide for people looking to pick up development, in the previous post
I show a way to set up your development environment on a relatively inexpensive piece of hardware. In this article
I will go over making a simple web application and how to get started with it quickly.

Many development tutorials make a simple todo list, we will be making an untitled todo list. If you are interested in
what the final product will look like, you can find it here [https://untitledtodo.xyz/]. The finished
source code can be found here [https://github.com/bblais23/untitled-todo-list].
