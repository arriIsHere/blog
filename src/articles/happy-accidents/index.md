I love "the joy of painting" It's a show I come back to every time I'm stressed, and it always sooths me. In that show the host, Bob Ross, gives 
painting lessons, but more importantly he gives people positive life advice. One of his most famous lessons was "we don't make mistakes, just happy accidents." 
It has taken me years to fully start to appreciate those words and I am still working on it.

## Mistakes

I should probably start things off with describing what I think Bob was talking about when he talked about mistakes. I don't think he was talking about the types of things
where we unintentionally hurt others. I think he was talking about many of the things we do everyday; the things we constantly beat ourselves up for, the things that other
people probably don't care about, or the things only you will notice. Mistakes are not a thing that hurt people, they are just things that are, things that because of how we
think about ourselves and (in some cases) the ways that our brain chemicals interact, we think are a problem. But they aren't, a mistake is just a decision that went in
an unexpected direction.

Mistakes are unavoidable, you will always make them, encounter them, and come to live with them. They are a large part of learning and growing as a person. You will always make 
mistakes, you will always do things you did not intend to do. There are many ways to deal with mistakes, you can torture yourself with them, you can blame others for them, you 
can swallow them and promise to never make them again, or you can accept them. I think this is part of what Bob was telling us. We are destined to make mistakes, feeling pain 
about it is common, but it should not be the default response.

## To Accept

Since 

A common belief with mistakes is that they are "learning experiences" or that "the more mistakes you make the closer you'll get to avoiding them" to some degree this is true
but I think it's counterproductive to think of them this way. Because mistakes are just decisions that didn't go the way we expected them to, they are not bad things outright,
they are just something that happens.
